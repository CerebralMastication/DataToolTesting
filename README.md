# Quick hit demo: DataToolTesting

This is a repo for testing some data tools using fake data but real scale. 

1. `simulate_imbalanced_data.ipynb` generates gigs of fake data of a certain shape. This is an edited version of the `df1` used in a working example I cooked up for the kind folks at Coiled. This just happened to be data I had sitting on my MBP when I started playing around. 

2. `query_parquet.ipynb` this is some example methods of quering the gigs of data produced in the notebook above.
